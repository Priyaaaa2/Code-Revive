# Code-Revive

Code Revive is an innovative application that enables developers to convert codebases between different programming languages seamlessly. Powered by the LLAMA 3 model, this app utilizes the GROQ API and is built with Streamlit, providing an intuitive and interactive user interface for efficient code translation.

## Features

- **Language Conversion**: Convert code snippets or entire codebases from one programming language to another with high accuracy.
- **Interactive Interface**: A user-friendly web application built with Streamlit for real-time code input and output display.
- **GROQ API Integration**: Leverage the GROQ API for efficient querying and data manipulation to optimize the conversion process.
- **Documentation and Support**: Documentation on the Code Base.

## Technologies Used

- **LLAMA 3**: A state-of-the-art language model for advanced language processing.
- **Streamlit**: A framework for building interactive web applications with ease.
- **GROQ API**: A powerful query language and API for efficient data handling.
